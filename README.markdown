Admiral registers vim-inspired global hotkeys for switching applications. It's
like `screen` for your GUI!

This is also a giant, horrible dirty hack. I make no apologies for this.

## Installation

For now, you'll need to build Admiral via Xcode.

## Usage

* &#8984;-C-h: move left
* &#8984;-C-j: move down
* &#8984;-C-k: move up
* &#8984;-C-l: move right
