Admiral registers vim-inspired global hotkeys for switching applications. It's
like `screen` for your GUI!

I wrote Admiral in a fit of productivity-induced mouse-hating rage. It is a
giant, horrible dirty hack. I make no apologies for this. I just want to get
back to work, dammit!

## Installation

For now, you'll need to build Admiral via Xcode.

## Usage

* &#8984;-C-h: move left
* &#8984;-C-j: move down
* &#8984;-C-k: move up
* &#8984;-C-l: move right
